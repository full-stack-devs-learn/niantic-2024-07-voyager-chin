                What test helped you find the bug?
                    - getPercentage_shouldCalculate_scorePercentage()

                What did you do to fix the bug?
                    - To fix the bug, the parentheses was added and a double data type was casted to the calculation
                      which was converted back to int on the return statement.

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
            - The getLetterGrade() function does not return the correct Letter Grades when tested.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            - getLetterGrade(), line 45-48

        What test helped you find the bug?
            - getLetterGrade_shouldReturn_gradeBasedOnPercent()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            - Instead of just greater than (>), the comparison was changed to greater than or equal (>=).
              The lowest value to return the letter grade "D" was changed to 60 instead of 50.

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
            - Possible points must be positive but the function returns a negative value when passed a negative value.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
            - getPossiblePoints, line 21

        What test helped you find the bug?
            - possiblePoints_shouldBe_positive()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
            - Added an if statement if possiblePoints is less than zero(0), it will return zero instead of negative value.

    Bug 4:

        Describe the bug/error:
            - score must be positive but the function returns a negative value when passed a negative value.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
